# How to solve a problem:
    # Figure out what the input and its type are
    # Set up a function
    # Figure out what the output and its type are
    # Gather Your Knowledge
    # Gathers Your Constraints
    # Determine a Logical way to solve the problem
        #Write each step out english
        #Write each step out in Python-esse
    # Invoke and Test Your Function

# ex
    # given an integer age 
    # Write a function to return a string based on the age
    # if that age is old enough to smoke(18) return "Can Smoke, Can't Drink"
    # if that age is not old enough to smoke return "Can't do anything"
    # If that age is old enough to drink "Can Party"
#steps
    # Figure out what the input and its type are
    # Set up a function
def what_can_i_buy(age):
    """Takes an integer age and returns a string that says what that age can do"""
    # Figure out what the output and its type are
        #Output a string with cetain value
    # Gather Your Knowledge
        #You have to be 21 to drink, and 18 to smoke
    # Gathers Your Constraints
        # if they are between 18-20 inclusive return a string "Can Smoke, Can't Drink"
        # if they are under 18 return "Can't do anything" 
        # if they are 21 and over return "Can Party"
    #Check the age and if it is in a certain range return its respective string string

        # if they are 21 and over return "Can Party"
    if age >= 21:
        return  "Can Party"
       # if they are under 18 return "Can't do anything" 
    elif age < 18:
        return "Can't do anything" 
        # if they are between 18 inclusive and 21 exlusive return a string "Can Smoke, Can't Drink"
    elif 18<= age < 21:
        return "Can Smoke, Can't Drink"

    
    #Invoke and Test Function
# print(what_can_i_buy(16))
# print(what_can_i_buy(18))
# print(what_can_i_buy(19))
# print(what_can_i_buy(21))
